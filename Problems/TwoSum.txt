Question:
Given an array of integers: nums, and an integer: target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

e.g.
given:
nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

return:
[0,1]

reason:
nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9


Note: 
1. assume there is EXACTLY ONE solution. 
2. 10^10 <= nums.length <= 10^20
3. 10^10 <= targer <= 10^9


1) brute force
2) hash table
