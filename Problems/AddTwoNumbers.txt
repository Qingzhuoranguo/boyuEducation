Given 2 non-empty linked list, representing two non-negative integers. 
The digits is in reverse order and each of the list's nodes contain a single digit. 
Add the two numbers and return it as the linked list.

e.g.
given:
l1: 2->4->3 
l2: 5->6->4

return:
7->0->8

reason:
342 + 465 = 807

note:
linked list size -> unlimited


1) brute force
2) step by step
